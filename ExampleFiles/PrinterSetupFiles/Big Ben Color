# it is important that there are tabs inserted after the colon.
# This version of the parsing system has an issue which means that
# you can only have a few tabs. The port to python should resolve this
# issue.

# Also note that currently comments can only be at the start of a line
# 
# Printer Setup Notes : Printer Name is only valid if it contains no spaces
