The Example Configuration Files within this folder are based from the cups configuration files that ship with Mac OS 10.4.7.

To use these files 
(1) Make a backup of your current /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
(2) Open the example of interest
(3) Search for '***" within the file
(4) You will see a note about the change to the cupsd.conf file and why it has
	been made.
(5) Copy the individual changes you would like into your cupsd.conf file.

NOTE : If an example configeration file has everything you require, then you may decide to simply use the example configuration file, however it is important to note that the system you are using may have a different version of cups, which requires a configuration file which is formated differently. Make sure you test the configuration file thoroughly when setting up a producation system.
