This PrinterSetup Droplet allows you to quickly generate PLF from PSF files

This script is in it's infancy and simply places the PSF name into the
PLF. As such it will not deal with hierarchies of PSF files.

Good Luck, if you make this more useable, please submit patches back to http://www.lucidsystems.org
