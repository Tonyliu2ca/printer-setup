The PrintSetupGenerateOSXPackageForEachPSF script allows you to quickly create multiple packages (one for each PSF file which you drop onto the script).

If you would like to have one Apple Package install for each of your PSF files then this script is just what you need.

Important! : Make sure that the PSF's (PrinterSetupFiles) which you drag onto this script are within the PrinterSetupFiles directory in the same PrinterSetupRoot at this script.

Hopefully this script supports (keeps working even when) the ~/PrinterSetup directory being moved anywhere within your systems the file system.

Good Luck, if you make this more useable, please submit patches back to http://www.lucidsystems.org
