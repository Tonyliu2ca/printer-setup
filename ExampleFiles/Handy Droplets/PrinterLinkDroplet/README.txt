The PrinterLinkDroplet allows you to drop PrinterSetupFiles (PSFs) and PrinterListFiles (PLFs) and create links to these in the PrinterSetupLinks directory. For each PSF or PLF dropped onto the script you will be propted with a dialog box which allows you to pass parameters to the commandline component.

To use the command line component of this tool directly you may find this script within ~/PrinterSetup/Examples/LinkGeneration/sh-enable-specific.bash
This Dropplet simply provides a conveninent front end to make link creation quicker.

This script has been tested on Mac OS 10.5.

This PrinterLinkDroplet is ideal if you are managing the PrinterSetupLinks directory.

Hopefully this script supports (keeps working even when) the ~/PrinterSetup directory being moved anywhere within your systems the file system.

Good Luck, if you make this more useable, please submit patches back to http://www.lucidsystems.org
