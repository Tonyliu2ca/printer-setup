#    Print Queue OS X UPDATE SYSTEM  #
######################################

This is the first revision of a system to autmatically deploy and maintain
print queues. This version has no support for drivers. Unless this is a post script. The goal of the completed first release will include drivers.

For now this system will just pull the updates down from the server.


Kind reagrds,
