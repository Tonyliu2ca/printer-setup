The link creation script directory is used to store scripts which configure links to PSF's and PLF's.

The "generate_links_for PrinterLists" script will create PLF links in the "PrinterSetupLinks" directory for any files or links to files found within the  "PrinterLists" directory within this copy of PrinterSetup.

The "generate_links_for PrinterSetupFiles" script will create PSF links in the "PrinterSetupLinks" directory for any files or links to files found within the  "PrinterSetupFiles" directory within this copy of PrinterSetup.
