The "additioanl_package" directory is used to store packages which you want the bult PrinterSetup installer to install in addition to just configuring the printers.

You may wish to add packaged installs of drivers or other packaged printing utilities to this directory to ensure that drivers are installed before printer setup runs.

To enable the installation of packages in this directory run the "enable_additional_pacakges" script found in the "helper_packages" directory. This will downlaod and install "InstallPKG" which will be used to install packages within this directory .
