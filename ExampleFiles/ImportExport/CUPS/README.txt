Hello,

Printer Setup is designed to manage cups print queues. 
As such no script export to cups script is provided.

Should you require assistance with running PrinterSetup then it is 
recommended that you refer to the Screen Casts which are available online.


Kind regards,
The PrinterSetup Team.
