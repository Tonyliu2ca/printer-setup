This script will take printers in CUPS and generate PSF files for these printers.

This script has been tested on Mac OS 10.5.

The backed components for this Apple Script are located in the following directory "/ExampleFiles/ImportExport/CUPS". 

If you are having any issues with the Apple Script you should probably also have a look in this directory and perhaps try running these scripts from the command line.

Hopefully this script supports (keeps working even when) the ~/PrinterSetup directory being moved anywhere within your systems the file system.

Good Luck, if you make this more useable, please submit patches back to http://www.lucidsystems.org
