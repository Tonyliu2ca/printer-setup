This script simply runs PrinterSetup with out any command line arguments.

This script has been tested on Mac OS 10.5.

Hopefully this script supports (keeps working even when) the ~/PrinterSetup directory being moved anywhere within your systems the file system.

Good Luck, if you make this more useable, please submit patches back to http://www.lucidsystems.org
